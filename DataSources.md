# Food Data Source Policy

ゴールトラッカー keeps bundled food data in two layers:

- `official/high`: copied from a brand's official nutrition page or PDF, with `source_url` and `fetched_at`.
- `estimated/medium` or `quick_estimate/low`: practical logging fallback, never presented as verified.

## Priority Official Sources

- Family restaurants:
  - ガスト, ジョナサン, 藍屋: official Skylark menu pages and embedded menu JSON were checked on 2026-06-12. Some kcal/salt values are present in JSON, but P/F/C is still estimated, so entries remain `estimated/medium`.

  - ロイヤルホスト, ジョイフル, 華屋与兵衛, サイゼリヤ, オリーブの丘: official menu/category pages were checked on 2026-06-12. Added representative official-menu-name or official-category entries as `estimated/medium`; P/F/C values are not official.
- 丸亀製麺: official menu and allergen pages were verified. Official P/F/C table was not found in the current pass.
- ウエスト: official menu page is store-scoped. Official P/F/C table was not verified in the current pass.
- 資さんうどん: official menu page is store-scoped. Official P/F/C table was not verified in the current pass.
- Convenience stores: add only product pages with nutrition shown on official sites. Regional and limited items should include source date.

## Import Shape

Use this shape for future CSV/JSON imports:

```text
brand,name,category,tags,calories,protein_g,fat_g,carbs_g,salt_g,serving_label,source_url,fetched_at
```

If kcal is official but P/F/C is estimated, do not mark the whole item as official. Split source quality in a later schema revision before importing mixed-source rows.
